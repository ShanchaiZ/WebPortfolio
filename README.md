## Introduction:

Building a Portfolio Website is essential for a Full-stack Web Developer as this website showcases the individual's compelling work while providing basic information to potential clients and employers.

## Project's Aim:
I created this portfolio project with the aim of showcasing the projects that I have worked on and the skills that I have gained. This is a great foundation to display the skills I have been learning and continue to develop from my bootcamp course.

## Technologies and Language used:
- HTML = Base Webpage skeleton and Contact Form
- CSS = Styling, Dark/Light Theme features and Responsiveness of site (Media Query)
- Javascript = Navigation bar and button functionalities, Modals, Qualification Tabs and Carousel
- Swiperjs = Carousel feature


## Learning Goals:
From building this Portfolio Webpage, I have learned that:
* Tidiness and being detail-oriented is essential in making the code render your vision
* Adding comments and commented headers ensure good organization and consistency of your code. 
    * This also made it easier to reduce sources of errors and hone in on potential errors for troubleshooting
* Problem solving skills were exercised through reading documentation and online research (mostly stackoverflow and youtube tutorials), then tailoring the solutions to my problem at hand through educated guesswork (trial and error) until resolution.
* Media Queries are easier to perform by designing for mobile platforms first then scale up to larger screens.
* Furthered my understanding of HTML and CSS.

### Installation:
